# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Working my way through Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)!

Note that the first 15 days teach Swift, not SwiftUI. I opted to skip these lessons as I already have experience with Swift.

| Description | Image |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Day 16: WeSplit**<br><br> A simple application to calculate tips and split the bill between friends. | ![WeSplit](Assets/WeSplit.png) |
