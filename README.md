# 100 Days of SwiftUI

Working my way through Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)!

Note that the first 15 days teach Swift, not SwiftUI. I opted to skip these lessons as I already have experience with Swift.

| Description | Image |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Day 16: WeSplit**<br><br> A simple application to calculate tips and split the bill between friends. | ![WeSplit](Assets/WeSplit.png) |
| **Day 17: GuessTheFlag**<br><br> A game where you guess the country of the given flag. | ![WeSplit](Assets/GuessTheFlag.png) |
| **Day 18: ViewsAndModifiers**<br><br> A test application that is more about learning how to use views and modifiers than creating anything. Lessons from this day were applied to the two previous projects. | ![WeSplit](Assets/ViewsAndModifiers.png) |
| **Day 19: BetterRest**<br><br> An application to calculate your ideal bedtime using machine learning. | ![WeSplit](Assets/BetterRest.png) |
